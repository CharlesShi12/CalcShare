## Calc Share
Calc Share is a calculator that allows for real-time collaboration between users. Essentially, multiple people can use one calculator at the same time with real-time changes.

## Motivation
There are many text editors that allow for real-time collaboration like Google Docs, however, there aren't many calculators that are able to do the same thing. Calc Share was built because me and many of my friends had a tough performing tedious calculations with partners during Physics or other STEM classes. Many of the times I would have to redo my partner's side of the calculations because I was worried that my partner accidently put an extra digit in the equations. For instance, 5X5=25, however, adding an extra 5 to the equation yields 275 (5X55=275), two totally different numbers, but one subtle change in the equations. Therefore, Share Calc was created to avoid situations like this.
